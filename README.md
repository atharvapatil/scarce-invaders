# scarce-invaders

Probably a dumb experiment by James, Lillian and Atharva.

- server.js     // Express server with socket.io to handle connections, game start, and score
- public        // Client side static page with p5 sketch
  - index.html
  - sketch.js
  - style.css

Intro text:
Welcome to Scarce Invaders!

Aliens are swiftly approaching the planet earth, and we need your help to stop them. We are able to control our fleets in deep space from this terminal, but only for thirty seconds at a time. Your job, soldier, is to kill as many alien invaders as possible with the time and ammo provided to you. Please do your best not to damage our ships. They’re all we have left.

Good luck! And may the odds be ever in your favor….
